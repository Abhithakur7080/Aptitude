Hurray! Correct Answer
Solution Description


When we plot the 20% and 40% profit in the number line, the difference will be 20.

But analysing the weighted average situation, the average of both the profits will be 25%.

Therefore, the ratio of the two groups (Table and Chair) will be  15 : 5

The total sum of the ratio is 20, but according to the question, it will be 2000, which is 100 times of 20.

Therefore, the cost price of the table will also be 15 * 100 times = 1500

Hence, the correct option will be option(a).

Hurray! Correct Answer
Solution Description
If the mixture is sell at 32.40 per kg, then the total gain is 20%.
Therefore, 32.40 is 120 percent of cost price.
Calculating original cost price = 32.40 * (100/120) = 27
That means the price of mixture would be Rs. 27 per kg.
Now, the required ratios will be = (27 - 25) : (32 - 27) = 2 : 5
