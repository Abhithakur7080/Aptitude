Hurray! Correct Answer
Solution Description
The factor of 216 that satisfies the above condition is 12,18.
So, 12 + 18 = 30
No other factor satisfied the condition. Hence, we can see only option (a) satisfies the given condition.

Hurray! Correct Answer
Solution Description
Let the two numbers be ‘a’ and ‘b’.
a- b= 8 and a*b= 240
If a*b= 240, then the possible combinations are (1, 240), (2, 120), (3, 80), (4, 60), (5, 48), (6, 40), (8, 30), (10, 24), (12, 20), (15, 16).
Since, a - b = 8 if possible only for (12, 20).
Required sum= 12+ 20= 32. Hence, option (d) is correct.

All Of These
Hurray! Correct Answer
Solution Description
11<√127<12, 11<√141<12, 13<√171<14 
For 127, we just need to check whether 127 is divisible by 3, 7, 9, 11. 127 is not divisible by none of these four numbers. Hence, this is a prime number. 
But 141 and 171 are not prime numbers.
Hence, option (a) is correct.

 Difference of 136 and 166= 30.
 Factors of 30 are 30, 15, 10, 6, 5, 3, 2, 1.
30, 15, 10, 6, 3 don’t divide 136 and 166. 4 don’t divide 166.
 2 divide both 136 and 166 both. Hence, 2 is the HCF. Option (d) is correct.

 Required size of the bottle= HCF of (506, 536 and 836)
 Difference of 506 and 536= 30.
Factors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5 , 6, 10, 15, 30.
Out of these factors only 2 divide all the three numbers (506, 536 and 836). Hence, option (d) is correct.

Hurray! Correct Answer
Solution Description
HCF = (x + 1)

LCM = x^3 + x^2 – x – 1 = (x + 1) (x + 1) (x – 1)

First expression = x^2 – 1 = (x + 1) (x - 1).

 Second expression × first expression = HCF x LCM

Second expression= HCF x LCM/first expression 
= ((x+1)(x+1)(x+1)(x-1))/((x-1)(x+1))= (x+1)^2
